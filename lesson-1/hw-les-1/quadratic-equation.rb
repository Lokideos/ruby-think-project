Program "Quadratic equation"
Program takes user input which is value of three variables 
usually called 'a', 'b' and 'c'. 
After that program will calculate equation rootes.
According to disciminant's value there are 3 possible solutions for the quadratic equation:
1) If D > 0 there are 2 roouts;
2) If D = 0 there is only 1 root;
3) If D < 0 there is no root for this equation.
As program output user should get discriminant's value and value of equation's roots
